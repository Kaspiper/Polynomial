Current Version of Polynomial class is done with integer coefficient Polynomials. Comes with polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, kernel (getter and setter), and java Object methods.
Polynomials with integer coefficients have closure under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
However, when trying to maintain closure of integer coefficients under division, Polynomial division starts to lose meaning and practicality. 
If you have a dividend and divisor with integer coefficients, and want the outcomes of division (the quotient and remainder) to also have integer coefficients, you may end up with remainder of a higher power than the divisor.

The next iteration of the Polynomial class will be done with "rational coefficient" Polynomials, which have closure under polynomial division. This implementation will be able to support more advanced and useful
functions like factoring, integration, and differentiation.
